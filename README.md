# ArrayType

This package provides a way to maintain type-safety using helper methods and arrays in PHP, allowing you to manage variables and arrays of a specific primitive and object types. It enforces runtime type safety by ensuring that only instances of the defined class can be added to the variable and array. This makes it easier to work with strongly-typed arrays and ensures data integrity throughout your application.

## Installation

You can install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require rayblair/type-safety
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s an example demonstrating how to use the `ArrayType` class with a custom object type:

### Define a Custom Type

First, create a class to define the objects you want to store in the array. In this example, we define a `FooType` class with `id` and `name` properties.

```php
class FooType
{
    public function __construct(public int $id, public string $name)
    {}
}
```

### Create a Type-Safe Array

Now, create a array class that extends `ArrayType` and specify the object type it will hold. In this case, `FooArrayType` is defined to hold `FooType` objects.

```php
class FooArrayType extends ArrayType
{
    public $type = FooType::class;
}
```

### Adding Items to the Array

Once your array is set up, you can start adding items to it. The array will automatically validate that each item is of the correct type.

```php
$array = new FooArrayType();

$array[] = ['id' => 1, 'name' => 'Ray'];
$array[] = ['id' => 2, 'name' => 'Bob'];
$array[] = ['id' => 3, 'name' => 'Alice'];

print_r($array->toArray());
```

### Output:

```php
[
    ['id' => 1, 'name' => 'Ray'],
    ['id' => 2, 'name' => 'Bob'],
    ['id' => 3, 'name' => 'Alice'],
]
```

## Handling Invalid Data

The `ArrayType` class enforces strict type safety, so invalid data will result in errors.

### Example 1: Invalid Type

If you try to add an item where the `id` is not an integer, a `TypeError` will be thrown.

```php
$array = new FooArrayType();

// This will throw a TypeError because the 'id' should be an integer.
$array[] = ['id' => '4', 'name' => 'Dave'];
```

### Example 2: Missing Parameters

If you omit required parameters, such as `id`, an `ArgumentCountError` will be thrown.

```php
$array = new FooArrayType();

// This will throw an ArgumentCountError because the 'id' is missing.
$array[] = ['name' => 'Gary'];
```

## Testing

To run the test suite and ensure everything is working as expected, use:

```bash
composer test
```
